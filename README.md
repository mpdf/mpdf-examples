# mPDF examples repository

## How to use

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP release
2. Initialize dependencies by running `$ composer install`
    - You will need to have [composer installed](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).
3. Then run example PHP files either from command line or from the browser
    - In the command line, the files are sent to `stdout`, the most convenient is to redirect them to file with `>` operator
    - In the browser, the output is sent inline to the browser so it should display in default PDF viewer

There is a generated list of example links for browser in the repository index.php file.
